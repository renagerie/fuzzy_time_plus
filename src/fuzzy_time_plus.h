 * HOUR_VIBRATE controls whether or not the clock will issue a short vibration at the
 * top of the hour.
 *
 * SHOW_FIVES controls the level of fuzziness. If set to 1, the clock will display
 * each 5-minutes of time ("five past", "ten past", etc.). If set to 0, the clock will
 * only show quarter hours. In either case, the top of the hour is split between
 * "almost one o'clock", "it's one o'clock" and "just past one".
